## Build Status

âœ… **Fixed**: Removed duplicate TimeRange enum from InsightsEngine.swift
âœ… **Fixed**: Removed duplicate YouTubeVideo struct from CoreDataManager.swift
âœ… **Fixed**: Updated SkillTrendChartView to use .foregroundStyle() instead of .foregroundColor() for chart axis labels
âœ… **Fixed**: Added division-by-zero protection in SkillTrendChartView trend line calculation
âœ… **Fixed**: **CRASH FIX** - Added bounds checking in CalendarHeatMapView to prevent "Index out of range" crash when accessing monthWidths array
âœ… **Fixed**: Resolved CalendarViewMode enum ambiguity by removing duplicate definition from CalendarComponents.swift
âœ… **Fixed**: Added all required Swift files to Xcode project:
   - CalendarHeatMapView.swift
   - SkillTrendChartView.swift
   - InsightsEngine.swift
   - YouTubeModels.swift
   - YouTubeAPIService.swift
   - YouTubeConfig.swift
   - NetworkManager.swift
   - CalendarComponents.swift
   - ManualDrillCreatorView.swift

âœ… **BUILD SUCCEEDED** - All build errors resolved! The app is ready to build and run.

**Latest Update**: Improved calendar heat map visual design to match GitHub contribution graph style:
- Better spacing between cells (3px instead of 2-4px)
- **Fixed month labels**: All months now display on a single horizontal line with proper spacing between each month
- Clearer month labels with improved font sizing (11pt)
- Consistent 12x12px cell size throughout
- Removed tooltip overlay for cleaner appearance
- Added 8px padding between month labels for better visual separation

Try building and running the app in Xcode (Cmd+R).
